            <h1>Educational Background</h1>
            <p>I studied senior high school at...</p>

            <h2>CIIT Senior High School Inc.</h2>
            <p>CIIT SHS was very culture-shocking—environment, teachers, events, and more. It was very different from where I grew up with and interacted with. It offered me the space and freedom I have been hoping to have.</p>
            <p>The first time I saw the school, I immediately loved it and wished to be a part of their community. Aside from the advantage of learning the specialized program I wanted, it felt like I could break free from my shackles if I choose this school. It wasn't well-received, of course. My personality of weighing the pros and cons and considering the opinions of others made me think twice.</p>
            <p>In the end, my heart won and I pursued CIIT. It was the best decision I ever made.</p>

                <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
                <p>I joined a music/performance club that was then called Pantheon x Dynamix. It consisted of people interested in singing and/or dancing.</p>

                <p>The following year level, it was rebranded into Musicateens. However, the club now only focuses on singing—solo, band, or choir.</p>
